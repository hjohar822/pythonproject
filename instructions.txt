Research Questions:
1. How does vehicle age affect charging cost efficiency, controlling for vehicle model and battery capacity?
2. How do charging patterns vary across user types (Commuters vs. Long-Distance Travelers) based on the day of the week, time of day, and the amount of battery percentage charged per session?
3. How does the ambient temperature affect energy consumption during charging sessions?
 
Key Features of the dataset:

User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
Vehicle Model: Model of the electric vehicle being charged (e.g., Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf).
Battery Capacity (kWh): Total battery capacity of the vehicle in kilowatt-hours.
Charging Station ID: Unique identifier for the charging station used.
Charging Station Location: Geographic location of the charging station (e.g., New York, Los Angeles).
Charging Start Time: Timestamp indicating when the charging session began.
Charging End Time: Timestamp indicating when the charging session ended.
Energy Consumed (kWh): Total energy consumed during the charging session, measured in kilowatt-hours.
Charging Duration (hours):Total time taken to charge the vehicle, measured in hours.
Charging Rate (kW): Average power delivery rate during the charging session, measured in kilowatts.
Charging Cost (USD): Total cost incurred for the charging session, measured in US dollars.
Time of Day: Time segment when the charging occurred (e.g., Morning, Afternoon).
Day of Week: Day of the week when the charging occurred (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
State of Charge (Start %): Battery charge percentage at the start of the charging session.
State of Charge (End %): Battery charge percentage at the end of the charging session.
Distance Driven (since last charge) (km): Distance traveled since the last charging session, measured in kilometers.
Temperature (Â°C): Ambient temperature during the charging session, measured in degrees Celsius.
Vehicle Age (years): Age of the electric vehicle, measured in years.
Charger Type: Type of charger used (e.g., Level 1, Level 2, DC Fast Charger).
User Type: Classification of user based on driving habits (e.g., Commuter, Long-Distance Traveler).
